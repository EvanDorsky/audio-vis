# Place this script into your project and run it to monitor specific project
# directories and all their subdirectory contents for file updates.
#
# To make this useful, you will have to:
#
# 1) Adjust the PROJECT_DIR variable as appropriate depending on
#     where this script is located in the project.
#
# 2) Add directories to the MONITOR array.
#
# 3) Add the set of actions to be taken when a change happens, such
#     as running a task, restarting a server process, and so forth.
#
# Note that this script blocks and runs until killed, so you may want to
# launch it as a background task.
#
 
# The absolute path of the directory containing this script.
